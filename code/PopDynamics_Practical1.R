#1. Generating capture histories

longdata <- read.table("data/sparrowrecap.txt", header = TRUE, sep = '\t')

head(longdata)

dim(longdata) #2378 capture observations across different islands in the house sparrow meta-population. 
#Data is in long format: each individual appears as many times as it was captured and where/when it was captured each time

length(unique(longdata$id)) #number of unique individuals in the long data format.

table(longdata$sex) #observations in relation to sex. Same number of males and females.

table(longdata$year) #captures from 1998-2007

table(longdata$island) #at 4 different island locations
#We need to convert this data from long format to wide format so that the package "mark" can analyse it.

temp <- longdata[,1:2] #take the first two columns, id and year and put into a temporary dataframe

temp$detect <- 1 #add column for detection (all 1s because these represent captures)

temp <- temp %>%
  # remove duplicates, which may occur when individuals are caught multiple times in an sampling event
  distinct() %>%
  # spread out data. The fill = 0 adds rows for combinations of id and year where individuals were not observed
  spread(year, detect, fill = 0) %>% 
  # for every individual....
  group_by(id) %>%
  # paste together 0's and 1's using unite()
  # here we are pasting the strings together from the second column (first capture event)
  # to the last capture event ("tail(names(.),1)")
  # use sep="" so there are no characters separating 0's and 1's
  unite("ch", 2:tail(names(.),1), sep = "")

sparrow <- as.data.frame(temp) # new dataframe called sparrow

head(sparrow)

sparrow$island <- longdata$island[match(sparrow$id, longdata$id)] 
# this creates a new column called island in the sparrow df...
# using the entry from the island column in the longdata df... 
# where id in the sparrow df matches the id in the longdata df

sparrow$sex <- as.factor(longdata$sex[match(sparrow$id, longdata$id)])

sparrow <- droplevels(subset(sparrow, select = -id)) # remove id column so capture histories appear in first column

head(sparrow)


#2. Simple Cormack-Jolly-Seber model

mod1 <- crm(sparrow) # capture-mark-recapture (cmr) model

mod1 # examine model and coefficient estimates

mod1 <- cjs.hessian(mod1)

mod1$results$reals # the estimates on the data scale are also stored within the results section of the model under ‘reals’.

#As with a binomial GLM, these estimates are on the latent (logit) scale. We can transform them back to the data scale using the plogis() or predict() functions.

plogis(mod1$results$beta$Phi)

plogis(mod1$results$beta$p)

predict(mod1, newdata=data.frame(sex = c('Female', 'Male')), se=T) # N.b. In this case, there are no groups or covariates in the model and so the 'newdata' argument is not used 


#3. Unequal sampling intervals
#This model assumes an equal time between each capture event. This assumption can be relaxed by including a vector of time intervals:
mod2 <- crm(sparrow, time.intervals = c(1,2,1,1,1,1,1,3,4))
mod2$results$reals

#QUESTIONS: These models assumed constant survival rates and detection probabilities. Is this a realistic assumption for this system? What term might you include in the model next, and why?
#I don't think constant survival rate is a realistic assumption. It can change between timestamps. F.e., maybe one year the winter is really bad and some individuals cannot feed enough to survive, while maybe the next year the opposite situation occurs.
#As for the constant detection probability, I guess the assumption could be somewhat realistic if the method of recapture is the same every year, if the same people are involved in the experiment...
#Different probabilities of recapture for different individuals?


#4. Including static covariates

#The islands in the meta-population are all different, and the probability of recapture may differ between individuals of different islands.
#We can test this by adding some additional complexity to our model and allowing the detection probability to vary between islands.

#In the marked package, this is a three stage process:
##1)Data processing

sparrow.proc <- process.data(sparrow) # built in function for data processing

str(sparrow.proc)

head(sparrow.proc[[1]]) # here we're accessing the values (info) stored in the first "item" of our list "sparrow.proc".

head(sparrow.proc$data) # we can also access that same column by using $ and calling it by its header

##2)Building the design matrix

sparrow.ddl <- make.design.data(sparrow.proc) # built in function for building design matrix 

str(sparrow.ddl)

View(sparrow.ddl)

head(sparrow.ddl[[1]])

head(sparrow.ddl$Phi)

# specify model formulation: capture probability depends on island

p.island <- list(formula=~island) 

mod3 <- crm(sparrow.proc, 
            sparrow.ddl, 
            model.parameters = list(p = p.island), 
            accumulate=FALSE, hessian = TRUE)

mod3$results$reals

##QUESTIONS: Does it look like detection probability varies among islands? Which island has the lowest detection probability? Why might this be? How might you compare this model with our simpler model above to see if it is a better fit?
#Yes, right now it dues look like detection probability varies among islands. Myken island seems to have the lowest detection probability while Gjeroy island seems to have the highest detection probability. Maybe "ch" column has on average less 1s in comparison to all other island, and the model uses that to predict detectability.
#To compare models we could look at the AIC; if it's lower for this model, then changing detection probabilities in relation to islands made our new model the best fit
#mod3 has an AIC of 2423.197, while mod2 has an AIC of 2691.993 and mod1 has an AIC of 2454.35. Funny enough, the second model is the worst fit and this last model is the best fit, but not by far.
#To get the AIC value without asking for the whole model we can just:
(mod3$results$AIC)
