#1. Generating capture histories

longdata <- read.table("data/sparrowrecap.txt", header = TRUE, sep = '\t')

head(longdata)

dim(longdata) #2378 capture observations across different islands in the house sparrow meta-population. 
#Data is in long format: each individual appears as many times as it was captured and where/when it was captured each time

length(unique(longdata$id)) #number of unique individuals in the long data format.

table(longdata$sex) #observations in relation to sex. Same number of males and females.

table(longdata$year) #captures from 1998-2007

table(longdata$island) #at 4 different island locations
#We need to convert this data from long format to wide format so that the package "mark" can analyse it.

temp <- longdata[,1:2] #take the first two columns, id and year and put into a temporary dataframe

temp$detect <- 1 #add column for detection (all 1s because these represent captures)

temp <- temp %>%
  # remove duplicates, which may occur when individuals are caught multiple times in an sampling event
  distinct() %>%
  # spread out data. The fill = 0 adds rows for combinations of id and year where individuals were not observed
  spread(year, detect, fill = 0) %>% 
  # for every individual....
  group_by(id) %>%
  # paste together 0's and 1's using unite()
  # here we are pasting the strings together from the second column (first capture event)
  # to the last capture event ("tail(names(.),1)")
  # use sep="" so there are no characters separating 0's and 1's
  unite("ch", 2:tail(names(.),1), sep = "")

sparrow <- as.data.frame(temp) # new dataframe called sparrow

head(sparrow)

sparrow$island <- longdata$island[match(sparrow$id, longdata$id)] 
# this creates a new column called island in the sparrow df...
# using the entry from the island column in the longdata df... 
# where id in the sparrow df matches the id in the longdata df

sparrow$sex <- as.factor(longdata$sex[match(sparrow$id, longdata$id)])

sparrow <- droplevels(subset(sparrow, select = -id)) # remove id column so capture histories appear in first column

head(sparrow)


#2. Simple Cormack-Jolly-Seber model

mod1 <- crm(sparrow) # capture-mark-recapture (cmr) model

mod1 # examine model and coefficient estimates

mod1 <- cjs.hessian(mod1)

mod1$results$reals # the estimates on the data scale are also stored within the results section of the model under ‘reals’.

#As with a binomial GLM, these estimates are on the latent (logit) scale. We can transform them back to the data scale using the plogis() or predict() functions.

plogis(mod1$results$beta$Phi)

plogis(mod1$results$beta$p)

predict(mod1, newdata=data.frame(sex = c('Female', 'Male')), se=T) # N.b. In this case, there are no groups or covariates in the model and so the 'newdata' argument is not used
